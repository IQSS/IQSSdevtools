[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/IQSSdevtools)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=IQSSdevtools)

# IQSSdevtools

The goal of **IQSSdevtools** is to makes it easy to initialize and compile an
R software package that complies with the IQSS Best Practices for Software
Development and Sustainability (IBPSDS).

The package will contain three primary functions:

- `init_iqss_package`: initialize a new IQSS Best Practices for Software
Development and Sustainability compliant package

- `add_iqss_package`: identify and add (when possible) missing Best Practice
compliant elements from an existing R package

- `build_iqss_package`: builds and tests IQSS Best Practice elements in an R
package

# IQSS Best Practices for Software Development and Sustainability [R Language]

`init_iqss_package` initialises a skeleton package that allows you to begin to
implement the IQSS Best Practices for Software Development and Sustainability.

- **Documentation**: Sets up documentation dynamically generated using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
and [roxygen2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=roxygen2). This includes a *README.Rmd*
file along with a package websbsite generated with [pkgdown](https://github.com/hadley/pkgdown).
The README.Rmd file should lay out core information about the package's motivation, methods and
include a dynamically generated "quickstart" example. `init_iqss_package` also creates a
*NEWS.md* file for you to document all changes made to the package by version.

- **License**: Adds a [GPL-3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

- **Version Control**: Sets up [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control.

- **Source Code Hosting**: If a GitHub authentication token is provided
with the `github_auth_token` argument, a new [GitHub](https://github.com/) remote repository is created for the package.

- **Testing**: Sets up the infrastructure for [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) with the
[testthat](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat) package. The basic foundation for external
continuous integration of these unit tests is set up with the
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) services
to run the tests on Linux and Windows operating systems, respectively.



# Relationship with `devtools`

**IQSSdevtools** largely builds on the
[devtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) package. It
wraps many of the **devtools** functions based on the Best Practices. As such,
feel free to use any **devtools** function when developing your package to
add additional elements/run specific functions.
